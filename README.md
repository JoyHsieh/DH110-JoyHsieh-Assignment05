# DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment05
## Introduction
**Purpose**: The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test the functionality of an interface in the early stages of design.  
**User** **Research**: I conducted a [heuristic analysis on two competitors](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment01) to my product, a [usability test](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment02) on one of those competitors, and a [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment03) with the other.  
**Personas**: Based on the research I conducted, I created two user personas. The first is Peter Chao, a retired grandpa. The second is Marlene Williams, a young professional. Their full user personas, empathy maps, user journeys, and usage scenarios can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment04).

## Features
1. **Multilingual Storytelling Platform** - provides users with prompts that cue them to share a short story about their lives. Entries can be typed, voice recorded, or video recorded in any language. Recordings are transcribed and saved with voice or video files. Entries can be quickly translated into any language
2. **Email/Text Integration** - lets users send prompts to others. When a user receives a prompt, they can reply to it with a response and it will be saved to the Storytelling Platform.
3. **Story Sharing** allows users to share their completed stories with family and friends.

## Tasks
This low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
- Watch a tutorial video
- Select a prompt to write about
